1.2:
The use and growth of multicore processors has lef to an ever increasing environment of parallel computing. Which means software developers have to account for the variety of parallel platforms and technologies.

Clock speed was once the main means by which to increase computational power. Due to fundamental limitations such as power and heat restictions and physical limit to transistor size.

For personal computers, industry too a page form the book of supercomputers. Instead of increasing the performance of a single core, why not put more than one in a personal computer?

This is sometimes called the multicore revolution which began in 2005. Most CPUs do not come with a single computing core.2, 4 8, and 16+ are common meaning parallel computing is a mainstay.

1.3:
Late 1980s and early 1990s
